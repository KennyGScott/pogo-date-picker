# Simple Date Picker

A simple calendar based datepicker component for Angular, very loosely based on https://github.com/kuvelas/mk-date-range-picker.

### Basic usage:
```html
<simple-date-picker [(date)]="dateSelected"></simple-date-picker>
```

### Inputs:
```js
importantDates: Array // An array of dates in YYYY-MM-DD format to be highlighted on the calendar
```

### Contribute
Like most libraries, this one could use some improvements.
